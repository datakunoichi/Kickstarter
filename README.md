🎯 **Kickstarter Project: Predicting Project Funding Success**

This repository contains code and resources for a machine learning project focused on predicting the success of Kickstarter campaigns. By analyzing various campaign attributes, the goal is to build models that can forecast whether a project will meet its funding goal.

📌 **Project Overview**

Kickstarter is a widely used crowdfunding platform where creators launch campaigns to raise funds for their ideas.
This project, led by Ho Wei Sin, explores key factors that influence project success—such as category, funding goal, campaign duration, and launch timing—using data-driven visualizations and predictive modeling.
